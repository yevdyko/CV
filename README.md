## Experience

**Ruby Backend Developer** (August 2019 - present)\
*HeyJobs*

A talent acquisition platform that helps employers find the right candidates by using performance marketing and allows the
jobseeker to find a job.

As part of the Jobseeker Team, I was responsible for the design and development of the backend for the jobseeker platform.

- Worked closely with the product manager to implement new features by splitting them into smaller logical parts and finding the best way to deliver them in cooperation with the rest of the team. Furthermore, I also helped to specify requirements during the development and suggested technical solutions.
- Did code reviews on a daily basis; provided a code quality with unit and integration tests.
- Built a system that includes the data import with job recommendations from files stored in AWS S3 Storage based on the data science pipeline and subsequent regular mailing of them using Mandrill as email sending service. Afterward, this made it possible to test different recommendation models and increase traffic to the platform.
- Introduced a new API endpoint for job recommendations integrated with the Content Delivery and CRM services that provides data based on the requested recommendation engine.
- Built a recommendation system based on Google Cloud Talent Solution API using a wide range of user data as recommendation sources. That allowed to involve new users that have not been active on the platform.
- Initiated the separation of the module for logging methods and HTTP calls to the internal library in a monolithic application with the possibility to move it to the Ruby gem that can be used by other services and will improve the maintenance and enhancement of this functionality.

Team: Team Lead, Product Owner, UI/UX Designer, QA Automation Engineer, 2 Backend and 2 Frontend Engineers. Technologies: PostgreSQL, Ruby, Ruby on Rails 5, Grape API, Sidekiq, Active Admin, JavaScript, React, AWS.

**Software Engineer** (April 2018 - July 2019)\
*iTechArt Group*

*Radian Generation*. A solar asset management app.

- Worked closely with the client to deliver new features, helped to clarify requirements during development and suggested technical solutions.
- Did code reviews on a daily basis; provided a code quality with unit tests.
- Improved code maintainability using SOLID design principles as part of extending existing or adding new functionality; highlighted areas for potential improvement.
- Mentoring a more junior developer.
- Implemented a custom fields functionality from scratch both on backend and frontend. This helped to reduce the number of customer requests for personalized changes in forms.
- Built an inventory system to manage and track spare parts, which allows to check quantities, make order requests, and view reorder history, set a low-quantity alert, and track the status of reorders. Technically, this included RESTful API design and implementation, covered with specs; structuring the backend data; sending notification emails under certain conditions and creating UI components.
- Worked with QuickBase and Dropbox storages: imported client files to the app database; exported tables and data for a backup purpose.

*Self-Employed*

As a self-employed developer, I was responsible for everything started from communication with customers and ended with deploying projects. I have implemented several mid-sized projects with Ruby and Ruby on Rails:

- A few brand promotion applications with content management functionality for end clients and resellers, including CMS features, responsive design, admin panel with Active Admin and deploying with Capistrano.
- A CRM application for the public quiz, where I made a number of improvements in the user interface, reorganized style sheet files according to the new supported file structure and redesigned the monolithic style sheet (10,000 lines of code) into reusable modules.

Besides this, I created a prototype of the POS system software for the local coffee shop that is still in use today. My involvement was to develop the user interface and the entire front-end part of the project.
